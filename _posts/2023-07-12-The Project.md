# The Project: The Text Analyse of the Ceres Website

_The final version of the project is given in this post._

The contents of the news in the news section of the website of the Centre for the Religious Studies at Ruhr University were analysed by text analysis.
## Part 1: WebScraping via OpenRefine
Firstly, I obtained the data required for the project by webscraping and edited it to make it suitable for text analysis.

**Step 1:**   Getting the links of 52 pages in the _News_ section

**Step 2:**   Access data on each page

## Part 2: Text Analyse via Voyant Tools 
Scraped data is downloaded as xls file and text.
The text Analysis, after uploading the text documents to Voyant tools is as follows:

To analyse only certain words, I used the "Whitelist" option:

In this project, in which I tried to analyse the use of the names of major religions in the "News" section of the CERES website, I felt the lack of participation in the "Text Analysis" course.
