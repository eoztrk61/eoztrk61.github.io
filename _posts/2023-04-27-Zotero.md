# Zotero 

Zotero is an open-source and easy-to-use bibliography management programme that helps to compile, organise, cite and share information sources. 

In today's lecture, I realised how much I did not know about a program I thought I knew. I had only heard about Zotero 2 years ago and I had learned it on my own and actually, I did not put that much effort into learning. I usually used it to compile and edit my bibliographies, it made it easier to write my term papers.

So today I learnt a few features of Zotero, such as bibliography citation and direct inclusion of any source from the web page. I was still doing some things manually :D
