# New Adventure

## Ready for Launch

Today’s lesson was totaly a new start for me. I do not have many
computer skill and at the beginning, I thought that this course was
going to be overwhelming for me. After two weeks, I started to
understand some logic behind how the some programs work. To remember and
practice I am going to write down everthing that I learn from each class
so that I can make some progress step by step.

**20.04.2023** What I learn today: - Create an account on Github (file
sharing programm) - Creating a blog by using Jekyll () - Other - https:
