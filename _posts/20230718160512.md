# OpenRefine 
I had never heard of OpenRefine before, but in the class today I realised that it is a very useful program, especially for obtaining and compiling large amounts of data from websites. The main features of OpenRefine are as follows:
_Free and open source
Data cleaning and filtering
Import data from various formats
Data reconciliation and matching
Ability to enrich data through APIs
Data transformation
Linking data
Advanced-Data Operations_

Of course, it is not possible for me to memorise the codes required for the use and transformation of the data. Since the lecturer will upload the necessary codes and steps to Moodle, the programme will be even easier to use. It looks like I will use OpenRefine in the final project.
