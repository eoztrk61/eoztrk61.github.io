# Text Analysis
Since I decided to use this type of analysis for the project, I would like to create another post about _Text Analysis_. Unfortunately I was not able to attend the lecture on this topic, but I will write here what I learnt online.

Briefly defined, text analysis is the process of analysing texts on a digital platform using computer systems in order to read and understand them. To do the analysis I will use VoyantTools, a tool in moodle that allows you to analyse and visualise digital texts.

I will follow the steps in OpenRefine in Moodle to make the scraped data suitable for text analysis. Then I will download all the texts and upload them to voyanttools.
Let's see if I can succeed.

For the text analysis, I will try to find out how many of the announcements and news published on the Turkish Foreign Affairs website contain the word religion and how often.
